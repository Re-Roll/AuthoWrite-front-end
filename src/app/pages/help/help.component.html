  <h2>Step 1 Upload Texts:</h2>
  <h3>Known texts:</h3>
  <p>Upload files or type/paste text in the textbox which you know was written by the same person. You can upload multiple files at a time using the upload known texts button. Accepted file types which are .pdf, .docx and .txt files. You can add the text currently in the “known text” box as a file by pressing the bottom right button in the box. Please refer to the image below:</p>
  <h3>Unknown text:</h3>
  <p>
    Enter one unknown text in the “unknown text” textbox or upload a single file. This text will then be analysed to estimate the likelihood that it shares the same author as the uploaded known texts. Only upload one file or enter the text in the textbox.
    To remove uploaded files from either unknown or known section, click the ‘x’ button next to the name of the file.
  </p>
  <h2>Step 2 Compare:</h2>
  <p>
    After you have uploaded or entered both known texts and an unknown text, press the “compare” button to see your results. The results section will show how similar the writing styles of the texts are to determine the likelihood of the unknown text being written by the same author as the known texts. This is represented as a percentage.
    The explanation section will show some additional information about your result such as word similarity. The numbers on the left side are the values for the known texts with the right side being for the unknown text. The blue bar represents how similar your known texts are compared to the unknown text for that evaluation metric
